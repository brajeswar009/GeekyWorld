## General info
This project is completely build with python as a core and uses Django filters extensively while maintaining best practices which are recommended while developing Django. The sole aim is to create a tech blog which will guide the normal consumer to buy a smartphone which will be best as per their requirements and best in value to price comparision. Here user can get latest tech news and unbiased reviews for smartphones. This blog will also support me to grew my already present inclination towards cutting edge modern technologies in many folds.  
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.7 or higher (3.8.5 recommended)
* Django version: 3.0 or higher (3.1.1 recommended)
* database : sqlite3 or any as you like
* HTML and CSS
* Javascript version: ES 6 or ES 7
* Bootstrap library version: 4.2 or 4.3
* any IDE can be used but VS Code is recommended.
	
## Setup
To run this project, fisrt install python from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).
After successful installation of python, you just have to install all used packages via requirements.txt file provided in the project link. To do that type below code in your console;
```
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to run the programm just type below code;
```
$ python manage.py runserver
```
Now you are good to go. Having knowledge on frontend technologies such as Javascript is added benefit but you can use google for any kind of need as I did.
